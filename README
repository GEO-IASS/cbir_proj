Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) Project

Note:
  1. Please copy the "MART" folder to the "D:\" directory before starting the program;

  2. The detailed user manual is in the experiment report;

  3. Command-line interface enables you to do batch experiment;

  4. Add the path to the source code to the MATLAB search path is highly recommended because
     the current direcitory will be changed if you reconstruct the database;

  5. The file records the 1000 accuracies and it will be placed under the current directory
     but you can refer to the copy in the "Accuracies Fast Access" folder to save time of
     running the program;

  6. This is a MATLAB program.
